# Hello-World
The first day of the rest of my life

Standing on the shoulders of a giant makes you realize that being small isn't so bad.

I am ashton, a nearing 30 dude who enjoys the outdoors, computer programming, and cooking good food.
I hope to contribute positively to the world one day, but for now I must learn.
